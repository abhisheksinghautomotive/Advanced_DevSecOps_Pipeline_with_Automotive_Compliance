## 2. Comprehensive DevSecOps Architecture

### Security-First Pipeline
```
Developer IDE → Pre-commit Hooks → SAST Scanning → Container Scanning
        ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Secret Detection → License Compliance → DAST Testing → Infrastructure Security
        ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Policy Validation → Supply Chain Analysis → Runtime Protection → Incident Response
```
